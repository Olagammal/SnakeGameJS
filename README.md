# SnakeGameJS
## About this Project:
The classic snake game implemented using JavaScript and p5js library for JavaScript,along with bootstrap for some styling. Feel free to make changes and point out corrections if any.
## How To Run:
There are many ways to launch a web application, but I used the "Live Server" extension in VSCode.
If you prefer launching via any server and you are using Mac or Windows,[refer this](https://gist.github.com/jgravois/5e73b56fa7756fd00b89).
If you are using Linux,[refer this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-18-04).

The following  instructions are for setting up the live server in VSCode.

### Setting up VSCode:

2. After installation, select the "Extensions" icon or press "ctrl+shift+x".

4. After installation,the "Go Live" button should be visible on the bottom-left corner of the VSCode window.

### Running the project:
1. Simply open the "index.html" file and press the "Go Live" button.
The game will start running on your browser on port '5500'.
